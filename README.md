# WaterDrop

WaterDrop is a simple app that helps you track your daily hydration.
It was build with UIKit and with use of MVC pattern.

## Description
Main goal of this app was to understand basics of building UI programmatically.
It is simple single-screen app so the MVC pattern works here well.

After choosing the time from which to which and by how many minutes, users can start the timer.
Label will decrement itself to 0. When it happens the push notification should appear, but to implement this, I would need paid apple developers account, so it will be added in the future.
