# WaterDrop

WaterDrop is a simple app that helps you track your daily hydration.
It was build with use of UIKit and MVC pattern.

## Description
The main goal of creating this app, was to understand basics of building UI programmatically.
It is simple, single-screen app and the MVC pattern works well in this case.

After selecting the period of time when the user wants to receive a notification, they can start the timer.
Timer label will decrement itself to 0. In this moment, the push notification will appear. To implement this functionality, I would have to pay for a Apple developers account (it will be added in the future).
